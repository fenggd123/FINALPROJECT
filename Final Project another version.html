        <p class="orange-text">Chinese immigration history in the United States can be traced back to the early 19th century:</p>
        <p class="orange-text">During the mid-19th century, a wave of early immigration brought laborers from Guangdong province in China to the United States. Primarily hailing from rural areas, these Chinese immigrants arrived to join the California Gold Rush in 1848. Subsequently, they played pivotal roles in building railroads and undertaking other vital forms of labor. Despite being heavily sought after for their inexpensive work, these individuals encountered severe racial discrimination and endured significant inequality.

        </p>
        <p class="orange-text">Chinese Exclusion Act (1882): As concerns and anti-Chinese sentiments grew, the United States passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. It was the first federal law in U.S. history to restrict immigration based on a specific country or ethnicity. It prohibited the immigration of Chinese laborers and continued until 1943.</p>
        <p class="orange-text">Family reunification and Chinese Americans (early 20th century): Despite the Chinese Exclusion Act, some Chinese already in the U.S. managed to reunite with their families through marriage and other means. Some Chinese immigrants also obtained U.S. citizenship through legal means, becoming Chinese Americans.</p>
        <p class="orange-text">Revival of Chinese immigration (after 1943): In 1943, the U.S. repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act, allowing Chinese immigration to resume. With the growth of the U.S. economy and demand for skilled workers, more Chinese started coming to the U.S., including many students and professionals from the mainland.</p>
        <p class="orange-text">Immigration reform and late 20th century: In 1965, the U.S. passed the Immigration and Nationality Act, removing nationality-based restrictions on Chinese and other nationalities. This provided more opportunities for immigrants from China and other Asian countries.</p>
        <p class="orange-text">Increase in Chinese immigration: From the late 1960s to the early 21st century, Chinese immigration significantly increased. Many came from mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, seeking better education, economic opportunities, and quality of life.</p>
        <p class="orange-text">U.S.-China relations: With increasing diplomatic, economic, and cultural exchanges between China and the U.S., the ties between Chinese immigrants and the U.S. have become closer.</p>

            <span class="orange-text">The Chinese Exclusion Act</span> of 1882 was legislated as concerns and anti-Chinese sentiments grew. It was the first federal law in U.S. history to restrict immigration based on a specific country or ethnicity. It prohibited the immigration of Chinese laborers and continued until 1943.
        </p>

        <h3 class="orange-text">Background:</h3>
        <p>
            In the mid-19th century, with the rise of the California Gold Rush and railroad construction, a large number of Chinese laborers came to the United States seeking job opportunities. These laborers were widely recruited because they were willing to work for relatively low wages. However, as the number of Chinese immigrants increased, it sparked a series of racial discrimination and anti-Chinese sentiments in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
            The U.S. government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, primarily based on the following factors:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Economic Factors: Some American labor organizations and unions claimed that the influx of Chinese laborers led to a decrease in wages and job opportunities.</li>
            <li>Racial Discrimination: Some Americans believed that Chinese immigrants had cultural differences from mainstream American society, and they feared that Chinese immigration might threaten American social and cultural values.</li>
            <li>Political Motivation: By passing the Chinese Exclusion Act, politicians attempted to cater to the racism and nativism prevalent at that time in order to gain support from voters.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="https://www.archives.gov/files/milestone-documents/images/doc-047-big.jpg" alt="first copy of the Chinese Exclusion Act">

        <h3 class="orange-text">Impact of the Chinese Exclusion Act:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Limiting Chinese Immigration: The Chinese Exclusion Act restricted the immigration of Chinese laborers, stipulating that except for a few special professions, Chinese individuals were not allowed to enter the United States. The act was initially effective for ten years but was later extended multiple times until it was finally repealed in 1943.</li>
            <li>Intensifying Racial Discrimination: The Chinese Exclusion Act reinforced racial discrimination and unequal treatment towards Chinese immigrants. It subjected immigrants from China to more stringent immigration inspections and unfair treatment.</li>
            <li>Propelling Other Immigration Laws: The Chinese Exclusion Act set a precedent for restricting immigration from specific countries or regions, influencing subsequent immigration legislation. For example, the 1885 Alien Contract Labor Law prohibited all contract laborers from immigrating, although it was less targeted, it still took some restrictive measures.</li>
            <li>Impact on U.S.-China Relations: The Chinese Exclusion Act deepened tensions between China and the U.S. It sparked anger and resentment in China and was perceived as a discriminatory and humiliating measure against the Chinese people.</li>
            <li>Immigration Reform: Over time, the U.S. gradually eased immigration restrictions, including the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act. In 1943, the Magnuson Act officially abolished the act, allowing Chinese immigration to resume and ending the more than six-decade-long era of Chinese exclusion.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The Chinese Exclusion Act had a profound impact on U.S. immigration history. It exemplified the negative aspects of restricting specific ethnic immigrant groups and perpetuating racial discrimination. However, its legacy also played a role in shaping more inclusive and equitable immigration policies that followed. Today, reflecting on the Chinese Exclusion Act highlights the importance of upholding equality, embracing multiculturalism, and rejecting racial discrimination.

        <h2>Inequality and Discrimination Today</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Add your content about the current inequality and discrimination faced by Chinese Americans here -->
            Despite laws prohibiting overt racial discrimination, some Chinese Americans still experience subtle inequality and bias in employment, education, and social interactions. The following are some current situations of potential inequality faced by Chinese Americans in the U.S.:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Employment Discrimination: Some Chinese individuals may encounter employment discrimination during the job application process. They might be excluded from certain positions or promotion opportunities based on their names, appearances, or ethnic backgrounds. While this discrimination might not be as overt as the Chinese Exclusion Act in the past, it still exists in some employers and workplace cultures.</li>
            <li>Educational Inequity: In some areas, Chinese students may face racial discrimination and unfair treatment based on their ethnicity. For example, some schools may impose strict admission standards on Asian American students, making it relatively more difficult for them to enter top-tier educational institutions.</li>
            <li>Negative Stereotypes: Chinese and Asian Americans may face negative stereotypes and cultural biases, being perceived as overly hardworking, intelligent, or unchanging. This may result in unfair treatment in social and professional settings.</li>
            <li>Social Discrimination: Some Chinese individuals may experience subtle or blatant discrimination in everyday social interactions, involving racial jokes, stigmatization, and unfriendly behavior.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1632/idt2/idt2/42f92a89-6c01-422c-a9a1-3a3a021eabea/image/816" alt="Kinds of discrimination reported(percentage)">
        <p>
            Compared to the past, attitudes toward Chinese Americans have improved in today's society. The Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed in 1943, and current laws prohibit explicit racial discrimination against specific ethnicities. In the past, Chinese immigrants faced strict immigration inspections and unequal treatment, limiting their opportunities in work, education, and social life.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, despite legal improvements, racial discrimination and inequality persist in some areas. Modern-day discrimination may be more subtle and insidious, but it still negatively impacts the Chinese community. There is much work to be done in the Chinese community's efforts to strive for equality and eliminate discrimination.
        </p>
        <p>
            To improve this situation, society needs to increase awareness and education. This will help eradicate stereotypes and biases. Governments and organizations should strengthen the oversight and enforcement of anti-discrimination laws. By doing so, they ensure that everyone has equal access to education and employment opportunities. Additionally, it is crucial to promote a diverse and inclusive atmosphere within society. This approach plays a key role in reducing inequality. Through collective efforts, we can create a more equal and just society where everyone enjoys equal rights and opportunities.
